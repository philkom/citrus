    <title>Trace variables</title>

    <para>You already know the &lt;echo&gt; action that prints messages to the console or logger. The
    &lt;trace-variables&gt; action is specially designed to trace all currently valid test variables to the console. 
    This was mainly used by us for debug reasons. The usage is quite simple:</para>
    
    <programlisting>&lt;testcase name=&quot;traceVariablesTest&quot;&gt;
    &lt;variables&gt;
        &lt;variable name=&quot;myVariable&quot; value=&quot;12345&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;variable name=&quot;nextVariable&quot; value=&quot;54321&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/variables&gt;
    &lt;actions&gt;
        &lt;trace-variables&gt;
            &lt;variable name=&quot;myVariable&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;variable name=&quot;nextVariable&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/trace-variables&gt;
        
        &lt;trace-variables/&gt;
    &lt;/actions&gt;
&lt;/testcase&gt;</programlisting>
    
    <para>Simply add the &lt;trace-variables&gt; action to your action chain and all variables will be printed out to
    the console. You are able to define a special set of variables by using the &lt;variable&gt; child
    elements. See the output that was generated by the test example above:</para>
    
    <programlisting>Current value of variable myVariable = 12345
Current value of variable nextVariable = 54321</programlisting>
