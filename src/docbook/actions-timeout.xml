    <title>Expect timeouts on a destination</title>

    <para>In some cases it might be necessary to validate that a message is <emphasis>not</emphasis> present on a destination. 
    This means that this action expects a timeout when receiving a message from an endpoint destination. For instance the tester 
    intends to ensure that no message is sent to a certain destination in a time period. In that case the timeout would 
    not be a test aborting error but the expected behavior. And in contrast to the normal behavior when a message is received 
    in the time period the test will fail with error.</para>
    
    <para>In order to validate such a timeout situation the action &lt;expectTimout&gt; shall help. The usage
    is very simple as the following example shows:</para>
    
    <programlisting>&lt;testcase name=&quot;receiveJMSimeoutTest&quot;&gt;
    &lt;actions&gt;
        &lt;expect-timeout message-receiver=&quot;myMessageReceiver&quot; wait=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/actions&gt;
&lt;/testcase&gt;</programlisting>
    
    <para>The action offers two attributes:</para>
    
    <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>message-receiver</emphasis>: Reference to a message receiver that will try to receive messages.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>wait</emphasis>: Time period to wait for messages to arrive</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
    <para>TODO: describe receive selected!</para>
