    <title>Sequential</title>

    <para>The sequential container executes the embedded test actions in strict sequence. Readers now might search for 
    the difference to the normal action chain that is specified inside the test case. The actual power of sequential containers 
    does show only in combination with other containers like iterations and parallels. We will see this later when handling 
    these containers.</para>
    
    <para>For now the sequential container seems not very sensational - one might say boring - because it simply groups a pair of test
    actions to sequential execution.</para>
